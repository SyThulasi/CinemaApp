The task is to develop a Cinema ticket reservation app and its back-end services (e.g.: bookmyshow / tickets.lk). This project is divided into two major sections as described in the high-level diagram below. You may choose one side of the project while one of your colleagues will work on the other side(s). You should develop your side of the project independently. However, you are expected to agree on APIs / Inter-back-end communication with other colleagues who are developing the other sides of the solution for all the sides to be integrated seamlessly into a working product.
